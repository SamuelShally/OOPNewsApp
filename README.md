### News APP

[Link to App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shallynews/id6474099927)

This project aimed to create an app that removed suggestion algorithms from my news feed. For a long time, I have been irritated by news apps suggesting what they think I want to read rather than what corresponds to the current top stories. 

In that vein, the goal was to create an app that worked two-fold, showing the latest stories from all sources and a briefing page to narrow down what you see to just your desired sources. 

The project achieved both of these goals. The app has a latest tab, which shows all the top stories from all sources, and a briefing tab that allows you to customize the stores you see between the WSJ, BBC, CNN, and Reuters. 

The system outputs the latest stories utilizing requests to the NewsAPI. The app takes in the user input for the desired sources via the settings page. 

In terms of unique requirements, the app is straightforward to use. Some aspects to note: I'm utilizing the free developer version of news API, which has a 100-pull API limit and serves articles with a 24-hour delay. This should be fine because the app has a non-existent download volume. But if you run into any trouble viewing stories, please contact me. Additionally, the app can be run through the iOS app store for iPhone. While it's designed for iPhone, you can run the iPhone version on Mac (Apple Silicon only) and iPad. You can find the download link at the top of the report. 

In conclusion, the project was broadly successful, and I achieved what I had set out to do.
